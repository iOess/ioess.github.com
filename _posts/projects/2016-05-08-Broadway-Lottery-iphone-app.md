My family has been watching musicals together for as long as I can remember. But it wasn't until I moved to NYC that I had the privilege to watch a Broadway production. And my first show? Watching my beautiful and talented niece perform in the King and I at Lincoln Center Theater! It was incredible! I can't get enough of Broadway and watched a dozen shows in my first 6 months living here... which got expensive as you can imagine. Luckily, lotteries help keep Broadway affordable and therefore accessible to a wider audience. I made the Broadway Lottery app because it's something all theater lovers, like myself, would use.
