I love learning about cultures, whether near or far. From traveling to Europe and being immersed in a new world of language, food, and history, or simply traveling to the opposite ends of my home state of North Carolina: the blue grass dive bars in Asheville to the laid-back beaches of Wilmington. And although I didn't grow up in a Filipino environment, I've always been interested in Filipino culture and took it upon myself to learn it. I'm proud to say I even started the Filipino American Student Association at my university. So I knew one of the first simple apps I wanted to make would have something to do with Filipino culture.
