I love learning about cultures, whether near or far. From traveling across the ocean and being immersed in a world of new language and food, or simply traveling to the opposite ends of my home state of North Carolina: the blue grass dive bars in Asheville to the laid-back beaches of Wilmington. And although I didn't grow up in a Filipino environment, I've always been interested in Filipino culture and wanted to stay in touch with my Filipino roots. I'm proud to say I even founded the Filipino American Student Association at my university. So I knew one of my first apps would have something to do with Filipino culture.
